db_settings:
  # Settings related to DB connection. Parameters:
  # db: the DB to connect to. Required. Default: mikado.db
  # dbtype: Type of DB to use. Choices: sqlite, postgresql, mysql. Default:
  # sqlite.
  db: /work/LAS/mash-lab/jing/arabidopsis/pool/mikado.db
  dbtype: sqlite
log_settings:
  # Settings related to the logs. Keys:
  # - log_level: verbosity. Default: INFO. In decreasing order: DEBUG, INFO,
  # WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  {}
pick:
  # Parameters related to the Mikado pick stage.
  # - alternative_splicing: Parameters related to which AS events to consider
  # as valid during picking.
  # - chimera_split: parameters related to splitting of transcripts in the
  # presence of multiple ORFs
  # - files: input and output files
  # - run_options: generic options related to the run, eg number of processors
  # to use.
  # - scoring_file: a scoring file for the analysis. Default: plant.yaml.
  alternative_splicing:
    # Parameters related to alternative splicing reporting.
    # - report: whether to report at all or not the AS events.
    # - only_confirmed_introns: bring back AS events only when their introns
    # are either
    #  present in the primary transcript or in the set of confirmed introns.
    # - pad: boolean switch. If false, Mikado will pad all the transcript in a
    # gene so that their ends are the same
    only_confirmed_introns: true
    pad: true
    report: true
  chimera_split:
    # Parameters related to the splitting of transcripts in the presence of
    # two or more ORFs. Parameters:
    # - execute: whether to split multi-ORF transcripts at all. Boolean.
    # - blast_check: whether to use BLAST information to take a decision. See
    # blast_params for details.
    # - blast_params: Parameters related to which BLAST data we want to
    # analyse.
    blast_check: true
    blast_params:
      # Parameters for the BLAST check prior to splitting.
      # - evalue: Minimum evalue for the whole hit. Default: 1e-6
      # - leniency: One of STRINGENT, LENIENT, PERMISSIVE. Default: STRINGENT
      # - max_target_seqs: maximum number of hits to consider. Default: 3
      {}
    execute: false
  clustering:
    # Parameters related to the clustering of transcripts into loci.
    # - flank: maximum distance for transcripts to be clustered within the
    # same superlocus.
    {}
  files:
    # Input and output files for Mikado pick.
    # - gff: input GTF/GFF3 file. Default: mikado_prepared.gtf
    # - loci_out: output GFF3 file from Mikado pick. Default: mikado.loci.gff3
    # - subloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate subloci. Default:
    # no output
    # - monoloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate monoloci.
    # Default: no output
    # - log: log file for this step.
    input: mikado_prepared.gtf

    subloci_out: ''
  output_format:   ##### Add this line - indent the same as 'fragments:' below
    report_all_orfs: true  ##### Add this line - indent the same as 'subloci_out:' above
  fragments:
    # Parameters related to the handling of fragments.
    # - remove: boolean. Whether to remove fragments or leave them, properly
    # tagged.
    {}
  run_options:
    # Generic run options.
    # - intron_range: A range where most of the introns (99%) should fall
    # into. Transcripts with too many
    #  introns larger or smaller than what is defined in this range will be
    # penalised
    #  in the scoring. Default: [60, 900]
    # - shm: boolean flag. If set and the DB is sqlite, it will be copied onto
    # the /dev/shm faux partition
    # - single_thread: boolean flag. If set, multithreading will be disabled
    # useful for profiling and debugging.
